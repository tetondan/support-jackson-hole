  title: What's up?
  description: >
    These are strange unprecedented times we are currently living in. As of this
    writing, COVID-19 has not hit our community but the economic impacts of
    self-isolation have begun to. Per CDC recommendations non-essential
    businesses have been asked to shut their doors and many have been forced to
    lay off staff. This town knows all about shutting down for a little bit each
    year, but most expect March to be a final time to make and save some money
    and hunker down for the offseason. While it may be hard to justify
    discretionary spending during these uncertain times I believe we can, as a
    community, support our local businesses so that when they are able to
    reopen, they are able to and will continue to employ our residents and
    support our community. If you are able, please help support our local
    businesses. As well, there are links below that will let you donate directly
    to the most vulnerable in our community. Thanks for your support and let’s
    get through this thing together.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
